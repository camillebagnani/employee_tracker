# Employee Tracker

## Description
This SQL employee tracker was created to allow users to manage an employee database. I used Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL to create the application. This project taught me how to create a connection to an SQL database, use MySQL queries to edit data in a database, use database data to dynamically create lists in Inquirer, use the .find() and .map() methods and more.
